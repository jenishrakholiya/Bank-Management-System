Bank Management System

This is a simple console-based Bank Management System written in Java. It allows users to log in using a default password, manage personal bank account details, and perform core banking operations such as:

🔐 Secure user login with PIN-based authentication

🏦 Deposit and withdraw money

📋 View account status and details

🆔 Check PAN card eligibility

💰 Apply for loans with conditions and interest calculation

✏️ Modify account holder name

The system is designed for learning purposes and provides basic functionality in a single-user or multi-user environment. All operations are handled using Java's object-oriented principles, arrays, and console I/O.
